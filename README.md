# Dession Tree Algorithm Practice:

# Decision Tree:
## Goal Of This Project:
This is for Practice purpose, which I am doing for getting better understanding of different Machien learning algorithm and models, understand them more and clearly, which will help me in the future " Of Course ", and I am using this dataset which I have created on my own, Which is BTS_FAN_Detector, ya I know What are you thinking This is one of the " quite odd and creatively childish ( I don't even know if there is a saying like that ), I just tried something different ", I already made a model on using Logestic Regression on this Dataset, so here I am doing my best to understand new the algorithms of the machine learning and today is a time for Decision Tree, "hmm, here's go nothig", THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
## ðŸ›  Skills

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm under graduat in IT I'm doing it from sindh  agriculture university form pakistan,
I'm very intersted in the filled of AI and it's subfilled Machine Learninig this project is my first project shows that what I have learned this few days, though it's not good as intermediate or master level even I can't compare it to other's and I'm stll learning, You may find some mistakes in my project and I Will be happy if you inform me about them but I'm still in leaning stage, And I will improve.
